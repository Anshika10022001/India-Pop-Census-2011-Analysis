# India Population Census 2011 Analysis

Aimed to analyze the Indian population census of 2011 and created Power BI Dashboard showing useful insights.

### Overview
 
 - The Census 2011 is the 15th National census survey conducted by the Census Organization of India. Mr. C. Chandramouli is the Commissioner & Registrar General of the Indian 2011 Census. The 2011 Indian National Census has been conducted in 2 phases - house listing and population. The national census survey covered all the 28 states of the country and 7 Union territories including 640 districts, 497 cities, 5767 tehsils & over 6 lakh villages.
- he Indian Population Census 2011 covered a number of parameters during the survey. These parameters include population, growth rate in population, rate of literacy, density of population, sex ratio and child sex ratio (0-6 years). According to the census reports of Indian Census 2011, the population of India is 1,210,854,977 with 623, 724, 248 males and 586,469, 174 females. The total literacy rate in the country at present is 74.04%. The density of population is 382 persons/sq.km. In regards to sex ratio, at present there are 940 females on average on per 1000 males and the child sex ratio is 914 females per 1000 males.
- The Population Enumeration offers needed Census data about land & its people in the present time. The survey reveals the current population trends, its varied characteristics that are valuable inputs for planning sound programs and policies aimed towards the welfare of India & her people and also for effective public administration.

## Analysis Framework

- Data Gathering: Collected the releveant data from [Census 2011 India](https://www.census2011.co.in/states.php) into the MS Excel
- Data preparation: The project involved using SQL aggregations to prepare and clean data for analysis. This included aggregating data from multiple sources and tables, filtering out irrelevant information, and performing calculations to derive meaningful insights.
### The whole code can be seen from the pdf file created in this repository [SQL Analysis Coding](https://github.com/Anshika10022001/India-Pop-Census-2011-Analysis/blob/main/INDIA%20CENSUS%20SQL.pdf)
- Population analysis: The project involved analyzing the population of different states in India, including their size, growth rate, and demographic makeup. This analysis was based on data obtained from reliable sources and was used to identify trends and patterns in population growth and distribution. The total population of India came out to be 1186 M

- Literacy rate analysis: The project also involved analyzing the literacy rate of different states in India, including the percentage of the population that is literate and the quality of education provided in different regions. This analysis was used to identify areas where educational interventions were needed and to track progress over time. Kerela topped the list with 94% of average literacy rate.

- Sex ratio analysis: In addition to population and literacy rate, the project also included analyzing the sex ratio of different states in India, including the number of males and females per 1000 population. This analysis was used to identify areas where gender-based discrimination was prevalent and to track progress over time. Kerala again topped the list with 1080 females per 1000 males.

- Growth rate analysis: The project also included analyzing the growth rate of population across different states in India. This analysis helped in understanding the population dynamics of each state, and how the population growth has changed over time.

- Population before vs. after: The project compared the population of different states before and after a certain event . This analysis helped in identifying the impact of the event on the population of the state and how it changed over time.

- Interactive dashboard: To present the analyzed information, the project included the development of an interactive dashboard. The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with features such as filters, graphs, and tables that allowed users to explore the data and discover key insights.
- Key insights: The dashboard provided useful insights about population, literacy rate, growth rate, sex ratio, and number of males and females by state. These insights were derived from the data analysis and were presented in an easy-to-understand format on the dashboard.
- Demographic trends: The dashboard allowed for a comprehensive analysis of demographic trends across different states, including population size, age distribution, and gender balance. This provided valuable insights into the changing demographics of each state and how they compare to national trends.
